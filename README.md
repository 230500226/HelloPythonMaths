## Description

The main script, [`scipyTest.py`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/ldxt460s/github/PythonHelloMaths/scipyTest.py"), allows users to:

1. Input a mathematical function of [`x`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22x%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
2. Define the range and number of points for evaluation.
3. Generate [`x`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22x%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") values within the specified range.
4. Evaluate the user-defined function over the generated [`x`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22x%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") values.
5.

6. Plot both the original function and the magnitude of its Fourier series using [`matplotlib`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22matplotlib%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python scipyTest.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

1. A mathematical function of [`x`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22x%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") (e.g., [`np.sin(x)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22np.sin(x)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fldxt460s%2Fgithub%2FPythonHelloMaths%2FscipyTest.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")).
2. The start of the range.
3. The end of the range.
4. The number of points.

The script will then display a plot of the original function and the magnitude of its Fourier series.
